Hi, I'm Natalie! I've been a gamer and computerer since I can remember - dating back to the late 80s and my Commodore 64. I managed to build a collection of 16 consoles and obtain a Master's Degree in American Literature simultaneously. Then I started programming with the aspiration to make oddball games and deep-left-field apps for Apple platforms. I made it happen with my apps reaching #1 around the world!

I've also completed a post-graduate diploma in Mobile App Development with distinction. I like obscure nerdy things, my bass guitar and karaoke. I enjoy encouraging others to do/make stuff, so I'm a speaker too - my past speaking engagements include 🍏 WWDC, JSConfEU, Rails Girls, Do iOS, try!swift. 

After making a few games, I worked on mobile payment and retail technology apps in Denmark and Canada.
I now live in Ottawa 🇨🇦 with my husband and work in fintech.
