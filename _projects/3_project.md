<p>My "Hello World" interactive iPad book app about vegetables, developed while learning programming + Cocos2d back in 2012. Done as a one-person-orchestra - without an artist, I also did the awkward graphics myself.</p>

<p><strong>🏆 Won Best iOS Education App at the Polish AppAwards.</strong></p>

<p>🏆 Reached number 2 in the Books category in Poland.</p>
